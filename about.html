            <h2>What is CLEAR?</h2>
            <p>CLEAR is an election prediction model that combines three critical data sources to forecast election outcomes with transparency and precision. Our model was designed to provide clear insights into the dynamics of election season, making complex data accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>The name "CLEAR" represents our goal: to make predictions that are Comprehensive, Logical, Empirical, Accurate, and Reliable.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="howItWorks">
            <h2>How CLEAR Works</h2>
            <p>CLEAR combines three primary components to predict election outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Polling Data:</strong> Weighted at 36%, sourced from <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a> and other national polling agencies, reflecting real-time trends.</li>
                <li><strong>The 13 Keys Model:</strong> Based on Allan Lichtman’s model, weighted at 38%, which has a strong historical track record.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Indicators (EI):</strong> Accounts for 26%, analyzing GDP, unemployment, inflation, and consumer confidence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these components is weighted to balance historical accuracy with current data, providing a comprehensive, data-driven model.</p>

        <section id="aboutMe">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm Dallen Larson, and I'm kind of a goofball. I'm 22 years old, and while I’m definitely not a politician, I am a programmer with a serious love for all things fun – especially game development. And though I'm not into politics, I do LOVE election season, especially the stats side. I love my family, my country, and programming – in that order.</p>

        <section id="accuracy">
            <h2>Model Accuracy</h2>
            <p>I estimate CLEAR’s accuracy at approximately 90-95%, combining the historical reliability of the 13 Keys Model and polling data accuracy. This percentage reflects the model’s balance between past election trends and present-day dynamics. This new model doesn't have any history to go off of, but I'm thankful to get it up and running before Election Day to see how accurate it is.</p>

        <section id="purpose">
            <h2>Why I Created CLEAR</h2>
            <p>CLEAR was created to provide a clear, unbiased election model accessible to all. I wanted to develop a transparent, data-driven tool that enables everyone to understand the dynamics influencing election outcomes.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="previousPredictions">
            <h2>Previous Predictions</h2>
            <p>Since this is CLEAR's first election, we don't have any past predictions yet. However, we’re documenting every step to refine our approach for future elections and build a solid track record of accuracy.</p>
            <p>Our 2024 prediction is that Kamala Harris will win by a margin of 3%. This margin places the result within our estimated margin of error, so we're eager to see if our model's accuracy holds. Stay tuned as we prepare for future cycles and develop even more robust predictions!</p>
