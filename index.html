        <h2>Our FINAL Prediction</h2>
        <p id="predictionResult">
            CLEAR's final projected winner for 2024 is <span style="color: blue;">Kamala Harris</span> by a margin of 3%. ðŸ’™
        </p>
        <p>
            CLEAR is a new election model that combines Polling Data, the 13 Keys Method, and Economic Indicators to produce what we believe to be a highly accurate prediction. While this projected margin of victory is within 10%, meaning itâ€™s close enough to be considered within the margin of error, our data suggests Harris as the likely winner.
        </p>
        <p>
            As this is CLEARâ€™s first election prediction, we're excited to see how our model holds up. We'll be refining our approach based on this election cycle, aiming for even clearer insights in the future. In the meantime, remember that every vote countsâ€”please go out and vote!

        <h2>Economic Indicators</h2>
        <div id="economicContent">
            <p>One reliable way to predict the outcome of a presidential election is by examining key economic indicators, which often correlate with the incumbent party's chance of success. Hereâ€™s how these indicators impact predictions:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GDP Growth:</strong> <span style="color: gray;">Mixed</span> - When GDP is rising, especially in the election year, it tends to favor the incumbent party. Strong GDP indicates economic health, which typically translates to voter confidence. For 2024, GDP growth has shown strength but is expected to decelerate, suggesting a mixed outlook.</li>
                <p> </p>
                <li><strong>Unemployment and Labor Market:</strong> <span style="color: blue;">Harris</span> - Low unemployment benefits incumbents by demonstrating economic stability. Despite predictions of a slight rise in 2024, job stability remains relatively high, which can positively influence the incumbent partyâ€™s chances.</li>
                <p> </p>
                <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> <span style="color: blue;">Harris</span> - Rising inflation often undermines incumbents, as voters may feel the pressure of higher living costs. Inflation has been moderating, with core rates close to target levels, which could be favorable to the current administration.</li>
                <p> </p>
                <li><strong>Consumer Confidence:</strong> <span style="color: red;">Trump</span> - While economic numbers are strong, consumer sentiment remains fragile, influenced by political and social uncertainty. Lower consumer confidence can sometimes shift favor toward challengers.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Overall, these indicators suggest a close race with economic factors providing mixed signals. As election dynamics evolve, economic trends will be one critical measure of each partyâ€™s chances.</p>
            <p>(EI - 3/3) Currently Favored: Harris </p>
            <p><em>Economic Indicators are weighted at 26% of CLEAR's Model.</em></p>
